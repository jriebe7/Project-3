# Project-3

Why this project?
People's musical tastes and listening habits can reflect different phenomenon in popular culture, history, and polities (https://slate.com/podcasts/hit-parade). Our project used the top streaming songs on various streaming platforms (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, TikTok) to detirmine what the top songs for 2024 are and how these vary by streaming platform.

Ethical considerations:
Our data came from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/most-streamed-spotify-songs-2024) and provided line level data with each line representing a Track or song. This was not user data, rather is aggregate data across users. This reduces ethical concerns about user data that is potentially identifiable. Furthermore, streaming platforms must abide by applicable laws (e.g., the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act).

Coding notes: We used ChatGPT, StackOverFlow, and office hours and instructor support in our coding. ChatGPT was especially useful for the pie charts using Altair. Altair was the library not used in class. We also used Psycopg2 to establish a connection from PGAdmin to Python.
